## Task overview

The project took about 4-5 hours to create the essential features.
Tools used :
* React
* Bootsrap
* Fontawesome.com
* React social icons (npm package)


## Problems i faced

I had trouble trying to deploy the app on github pages, i still dont know what went wrong. I had to deploy it on heroku which i am more familiar with.

## What i learned
When i first started building the project i thought that there wouldn't be much css used, therefore i simply added css by injecting it on to the react components directly. I should have created seperate css files which i then import via. the react components

## Other stuff

There are couple of css issues which i might still fix and the project file management could use some work.
other than that i think i did a pretty good job!
